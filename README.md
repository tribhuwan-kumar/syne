## Overview

syne is a lightweight, modern Flutter application designed to simplify remote Linux system management over SSH. It provides an intuitive interface for monitoring system performance, managing files, and executing essential controls without relying on a terminal for routine tasks.

The app brings together key administrative functions into a unified dashboard, allowing users to view real-time system metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk utilization, and running processes. It also includes a built-in file explorer with support for uploading and downloading files, making remote file management seamless and efficient.

If you work with Linux systems regularly, you probably run:

```bash
top
df -h
````

multiple times a day.

**syne** eliminates that repetition by bringing system monitoring and control directly to your phone.
